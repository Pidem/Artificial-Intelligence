## Artificial-Intelligence

I uploaded to this repository the various projects I worked on for my Artificial Intelligence course at columbia

#Search Algorithms (8-puzzle game)

Create an agent to solve the 8-puzzle game : Given an initial state of the board, the combinatorial search problem is to find a sequence of
moves that transitions this state to the goal state; that is, the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending order ⟨0, 1,…, m^2 − 1⟩. The search space is the set of all possible states reachable from the initial state.

bfs (Breadth-First Search)
dfs (Depth-First Search)
ast (A-Star Search)

#Adversarial Search (2048 game)

Create an agent to intelligently play the 2048-puzzle game (gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048): Goal is to reach the 2048 tile. Implementation of an adversarial search algorithm (minimax algorithm) with several heuristics

Minimax algorithm and heuristics

#Machine Learning 

Perceptron Algorithm
Regressions
Classification algorithms: SVM, NaiveBayes, etc 

#Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Sudoku Solver)

Implementing the AC-3 and backtracking algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. The
objective of the game is just to fill a 9 x 9 grid with numerical digits so that each column,
each row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-grids (also called boxes) contains one of all of
the digits 1 through 9.
